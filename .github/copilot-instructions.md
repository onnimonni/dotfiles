# Dotfiles for MacOS Setup
These are dotfiles for my personal MacOS setup. They are managed using Nix and `nix-darwin`.

They still contain few traces from old rcup based setup but they are gradually being replaced with Nix configurations.

## Principles to follow
* Use idiomatic nix with flakes to manage the configuration.
* Act as a grumpy senior engineer. Keep answers concise and to the point.
* Avoid unnecessary explanations or details.
* Focus on practical solutions and best practices.
* Be direct and straightforward in responses, cutting to the chase without fluff.
